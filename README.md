Real Estate Market Analysis
==============================

What Is This?
-------------
This is the first script (data extraction and concatenation) in my Real Estate Market data app.
I will slowly move the whole app to a public repository once I finish and tidy up the code.

Should I Use This?
-------------
This is part of a personal project. It is used as an aid in a side business. <br>

How To Use This
---------------
Open project with editor of choice. <br>
Manually edit the start (d1) and end (d2) dates in the config file.<br>
Run the following Python command in terminal to install all dependencies:<br>
```
python setup.py
```
Run the code cells in the Jupyter notebook individually (or the whole thing at once) to extract and concatenate the data. <br>
